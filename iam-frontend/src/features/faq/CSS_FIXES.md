# FAQ CSS Issues - Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **Incomplete Tailwind CSS imports** - Only preflight and utilities were imported, missing base and components
2. **Theme conflicts** - FAQ component designed with dark theme but main app CSS was overriding styles
3. **Text visibility problems** - Low contrast and faded text due to conflicting CSS variables
4. **Layout styling issues** - Missing proper CSS isolation for the FAQ feature

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Tailwind CSS Imports
**File:** `/src/index.css`
```css
// Before:
@import "tailwindcss/preflight";
@tailwind utilities;

// After:
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

### 2. Added FAQ-Specific CSS Isolation
**File:** `/src/features/faq/FAQ.css` (NEW)
- Created dedicated CSS file for FAQ component
- Added `!important` overrides to ensure proper text visibility
- Forced dark theme styling with `color-scheme: dark`
- Fixed input, button, and card styling
- Ensured white text and proper contrast

### 3. Updated FAQ Component
**File:** `/src/features/faq/index.jsx`
- Added CSS import: `import './FAQ.css'`
- Added `faq-container` class for CSS targeting
- Added `style={{ colorScheme: 'dark' }}` for browser theme

## Expected Results
✅ **Text Visibility**: All text should now be clearly visible with proper contrast
✅ **Dark Theme**: FAQ page maintains its intended dark aesthetic
✅ **Typography**: Headers, paragraphs, and UI elements display correctly
✅ **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, inputs, and cards have proper styling
✅ **Layout**: No more condensed or broken layout issues

## Testing
The development server should now display the FAQ page with:
- Crisp white text on dark background
- Properly styled category buttons
- Clear search input with placeholder text
- Well-defined FAQ cards with proper spacing
- Functional modal overlays

## CSS Isolation Strategy
The FAQ component now uses:
1. **Scoped CSS class** (`.faq-container`) for targeted styling
2. **Specific overrides** with `!important` to prevent conflicts
3. **Color-scheme directive** for browser-level theming
4. **Complete Tailwind imports** for full utility access
