# FAQ Feature - Refactored Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains the refactored FAQ feature, transformed from a monolithic single-file component into a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture. The refactoring follows React best practices and improves code organization, reusability, and accessibility.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
src/features/faq/
├── index.jsx                 # Main container component
├── data.js                   # FAQ data and categories
├── README.md                 # This documentation
├── components/               # UI Components
│   ├── AnimatedGradientBackground.jsx
│   ├── CategorySelector.jsx
│   ├── ContactCard.jsx
│   ├── FAQCard.jsx
│   ├── FAQHeader.jsx
│   ├── FAQModal.jsx
│   └── NoResults.jsx
└── hooks/                    # Custom hooks
    ├── useDebounce.js
    └── useMousePosition.js
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modularity**
- Separated data, logic, and UI concerns
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Improved code reusability across the application

### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- Extracted custom hooks for debouncing and mouse tracking
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized event handlers with useCallback

### 3. **Accessibility Enhancements**
- Added ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Implemented keyboard navigation and focus trapping
- Enhanced semantic HTML structure

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and debugging
- Simplified component updates and feature additions

## Components

### Container Component
- **`index.jsx`**: Main container that manages state and orchestrates child components

### UI Components
- **`FAQHeader.jsx`**: Search bar and page title
- **`CategorySelector.jsx`**: Category filter buttons
- **`FAQCard.jsx`**: Individual FAQ item display
- **`FAQModal.jsx`**: Detailed FAQ view with accessibility features
- **`NoResults.jsx`**: Empty state when no results match filters
- **`ContactCard.jsx`**: Support contact call-to-action
- **`AnimatedGradientBackground.jsx`**: Interactive background animation

### Custom Hooks
- **`useDebounce.js`**: Debounces input values for performance
- **`useMousePosition.js`**: Tracks mouse position for animations

### Data
- **`data.js`**: Contains FAQ data and category configurations

## Usage

To use the FAQ feature in your application:

```jsx
import FAQPage from './features/faq';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FAQPage />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
4. **Performance**: Optimized rendering and event handling
5. **Accessibility**: Enhanced for users with disabilities
6. **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and separation of concerns

## Migration Notes

The original monolithic component has been completely restructured while maintaining all existing functionality:

- All interactive features preserved
- Performance optimizations maintained
- Visual design unchanged
- Enhanced accessibility added
- Improved code organization

## Future Enhancements

With this modular architecture, future enhancements can be easily implemented:

- URL state synchronization
- Analytics tracking
- A/B testing different layouts
- Integration with content management systems
- Multi-language support
- Advanced search features
